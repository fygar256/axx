GENERAL ASSEMBLER 'axx.py'

I wrote it in python, so the nickname is Paxx.

# Test environment

Arch linux terminal

# Main text

axx.py is a general assembler that generalizes assemblers.

The execution platform is not dependent on a specific processing system. It is also set to ignore chr(13) at the end of lines in DOS files. It will work on any processing system that runs python.

axx can process assembly for any processor architecture if you prepare pattern data, but it does not support the practical functions of dedicated assemblers. The current version is a trial implementation. I also intend to implement the practical functions of dedicated assemblers in the future.

Also, because the pattern file is separate from the source file, it is possible to generate machine code for a processor with a different instruction set from a source file with one instruction set, if you don't mind the effort of coding.

#### How to use

Use it like this:`python axx.py patternfile.axx [sample.s] [-o outfile.bin]`.

axx reads assembler pattern data from the first argument, and assembles the source file of the second argument based on the pattern data. If the second argument is omitted, the source is input from the standard input.

The result is output as text to the standard output, and if there is an argument specified with the `-o` option, a binary file is output to the current directory.

In axx, the assembly language source file or the line input from the standard input is named an assembly line.

## Explanation of the pattern file

Pattern files are user-defined to correspond to individual processors.

The pattern data in the pattern file is arranged as follows:

```
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
:
:
```

Instruction cannot be omitted. Error_patterns can be omitted. Binary_list cannot be omitted.

Instruction, error_patterns, and binary_list should be separated by `::`.

for ex. (x86_64)

```
RET :: 0xc3
```

There are two types of pattern data:

``
(1) instruction :: binary_list
(2) instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
```

#### Comments

If you write `/*` in the pattern file, the part after `/*` on that line becomes a comment. Currently, you cannot close it with `*/`. It is only valid after `/*` on that line.

#### Case Sensitivity, Variables

Uppercase letters in the pattern file are treated as character constants. Lowercase letters are treated as one-character variables. The value of the factor, expression, or symbol at that position in the instruction is assigned to the variable from the assembly line, and referenced from error_patterns and binary_list.

Lowercase letters a through g represent expressions, h through n represent factors such as constants, and o through z represent symbols. All unassigned variables have a default value of 0.

Uppercase and lowercase letters are accepted as the same by the assembly line.

A special variable is '$$', which represents the current location counter.

#### Operator precedence

The operators and precedence are as follows, based on Python

```
(expression)          An expression enclosed in parentheses
#                     An operator that returns the value of a symbol
-,~                   Negative, bitwise NOT
@                     A unary operator that returns the bit position from the right of the most significant bit of the following value
:=                    Assignment operator
**                    Exponentiation
*,//                  Multiplication, integer division
+,-                   Addition, subtraction
<<,>>                 Left shift, right shift
&                     Bitwise AND
|                     Bitwise OR
^                     Bitwise XOR
'                     Sign extension
<=,<,>,>=,!=,==       Comparison operators
not(x)                Logical NOT
&&                    Logical AND
||                    Logical OR
```

There is an assignment operator `:=`. If you enter `d:=24`, 24 will be assigned to the variable d. The value of the assignment operator is the assigned value.

The prefix operator `#` takes the value of the following symbol.

The prefix operator `@` returns the number of bits in the value that follows. We call this the snake-shaped Marmatta operator.

The binary operator `'`, for example `a'24`, will sign extend (Sign EXtend) the 24th bit of a as the sign bit. We call this the SEX operator.

The binary operator `**` is exponentiation.

#### Escape character

The escape character `\` can be used in the instruction.

#### error_patterns

error_patterns uses variables and comparison operators to specify the conditions under which an error occurs.

Multiple error patterns can be specified, separated by ','. For example, as follows.

```
a>3;4,b>7;5
```
In this example, if a>3, error code 4 is returned, and if b>7, error code 5 is returned.

#### binary_list

binary_list specifies the code to be output, separated by ','. For example, if you specify 0x03,d, d will be output after 0x3.

Let's take 8048 as an example. If the pattern file contains

```
ADD A,Rn :: n>7;5 :: n|0x68
```

and you pass `add a,rn` to the assembly line, it will return error code 5 when n>7, and `add a,r1` will generate binary 0x69.

If an element of binary_list is empty, it will be aligned. If it starts with `,` or if it is `0x12,,0x13`, the empty part will be padded up to the exact address.

If an element of binary_list is preceded by `;`, it will not be output if the element is 0.

#### symbol

```
.setsym :: symbol :: n
```

When you write this, symbol is defined with the value n.

Symbols are letters, numbers, and some symbol strings.

To define symbol2 with symbol1, write as follows.

```
.setsym ::symbol1 ::1
.setsym ::symbol2 ::#symbol1
```

Here is an example of symbol definition for z80. If you write the following in a pattern file:

```
.setsym ::B ::0
.setsym ::C ::1
.setsym ::D ::2
.setsym ::E ::3
.setsym ::H ::4
.setsym ::L ::5
.setsym ::A ::7
.setsym ::BC ::0x00
.setsym ::DE ::0x10
.setsym ::HL ::0x20
.setsym ::SP ::0x30
```

The symbols B, C, D, E, H, L, A, BC, DE, HL, and SP will be defined as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0x00, 0x10, 0x20, and 0x30, respectively. Symbols are not case sensitive.

If there are multiple definitions of the same symbol in the pattern file, the new one will replace the old one. That is,

```
.setsym ::B::0
.setsym ::C::1
ADD A,s

.setsym ::NZ::0
.setsym ::Z::1
.setsym ::NC::2
.setsym ::C ::3
RET s
```
In this case, the C in ADD A,C is 1, and the C in RET C is 3.

ãƒ»Example of a symbol that contains a mixture of symbols, numbers, and letters

```
.setsym ::$s5:: 21
```

Use `.clearsym` to clear all symbols.

```
.clearsym
```

You can specify the character set to be used for symbols from within the pattern file.

```
.symbolc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters in `<characters>`.

The default is alphabet + numbers + `'_%$-~&|'`.

#### Pattern order

```
(1) LD A,(HL)
(2) LD A,d
```

Pattern files are evaluated from top to bottom, so the one placed earlier takes precedence. Special patterns are placed first, and general patterns are placed afterwards.

#### Double brackets

Optional items in the instruction can be enclosed in double brackets. Here is the `inc (ix)` instruction for the z80.

```
INC (IX[[+d]]) :: 0xdd,0x34,d
```

In this case, the initial value of the lowercase variable is 0, so if you specify `inc (ix+0x12)`, `0xdd,0x34,0x12` will be output if you do not omit it, and if you specify `inc (ix)`, `0xdd,0x34,0x00` will be output if you omit it.

#### Specifying the padding bytecode

From the pattern file,

```
.padding 0x12
```

Then the padding bytecode will be 0x12. The default is 0x00.

## Explanation of assembly files

#### label

Labels can be defined from the assembly line in the following way.

```
label1:
label2: .equ 0x10
label3: nop
```

A label is a string of letters, numbers, and some symbols, starting with a non-numeric ``.`, alphabet, or some symbol, and is two or more characters long.

To define a label with a label, do the following:

```
label4: .equ label1
```

You can determine the character set to be used for the label from within the pattern file.

```
.labelc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase alphabets with `<characters>`.

The default is alphabet + numbers + underscore. `.` is only allowed at the beginning of the label.

#### ORG

ORG is set to

```
.org 0x800
```

From the assembly line, use the following.

#### Alignment

If you enter .align 16 from an assembly line,

```
.align 16
```

it will align to 16 (pad with the bytecode specified by .padding up to an address that is a multiple of 16). If you omit the argument, it will align to the value specified by the previous .align or the default value.

#### Floating point, number notation

For example, suppose you have a processor that includes floating point operands, and `MOVF fa,3.14` loads 3.14 into the fa register, with the opcode being 01. In this case, the pattern data is

```
MOVF FA,d ::0x01,d>>24,d>>16,d>>8,d
```

If you pass `movf fa,0f3.14` to the assemble line, the binary output will be 0x01,0xc3,0xf5,0x48,0x40.

Prefix binary numbers with '0b'.

Prefix hexadecimal numbers with '0x'.

Prefix floating-point float (32bit) with '0f'.

Prefix floating-point double (float 64bit) with '0d'.

#### Strings

`.ascii` outputs the bytecode of a string, and `.asciiz` outputs the bytecode of a string with 0x00 at the end.

```
.ascii "sample1"
.asciiz "sample2"
```

#### Comments

Assembly line comments are `;`.

## Example of binary output

```
.setsym:: BC:: 0x00
.setsym:: DE:: 0x10
.setsym:: HL:: 0x20
LD s,d:: (s&0xf!=0)||(s>>4)>3;9 :: s|0x01,d&0xff,d>>8
```

Then, `ld bc,0x1234, ld de,0x1234, ld hl,0x1234` output `0x01,0x34,0x12, 0x11,0x34,0x12, 0x21,0x34,0x12`, respectively.

### Test of some instructions on some processors

This is a test, so the binary is different from the actual code.

## Comments

ãƒ»Sorry for original notation.

ãƒ»Error checking is poor.

ãƒ»I know it's a bit of a stretch, but quantum computers and LISP machines are not supported.

The assembly language for quantum computers is called quantum assembly, and is not assembly language.

LISP machine programs are not assembly language.

ãƒ»From homemade processors to supercomputers, please feel free to use it. Meow.

ãƒ»Since an emulator must be installed, run-time variable-length byte instructions are not supported.

ãƒ»Assembling is possible for processors with less than 8 bits, such as bit slice processors, and processors whose machine language words are not in bytes, but since the output of axx is in bytes, processing is required. Whether processing is required also depends on the specifications of the binary file format that may be implemented in the future.

ãƒ»The pattern data is written differently depending on the addressing mode.

ãƒ»Please evaluate and extend and fix this.

ãƒ»Error checking is easier if the pattern file is written in a meta-language. It is highly readable. It is not dependent on the order of evaluation.

## Future issues

ãƒ»The order of evaluation of the pattern file is difficult, so we will do something about it.

ãƒ»Make it possible for the linker to handle it.

ãƒ»Do more error checking.

ãƒ»Escape characters in expressions don't work, and I'd like to solve that.

ãƒ»I'd like to add a macro function.

ãƒ»Support binary file formats.

GENERAL ASSEMBLER 'axx.py'

I wrote it in python, so the nickname is Paxx.

# Test environment

Arch linux terminal

# Main text

axx.py is a general assembler that generalizes assemblers.

The execution platform is not dependent on a specific processing system. It is also set to ignore chr(13) at the end of lines in DOS files. I think it will work on any processing system that runs python.

I think axx can process assembly for any processor if you prepare pattern data, but it does not support the practical functions that a dedicated assembler has. The current version is a trial implementation. I also intend to implement the practical functions of a dedicated assembler in the future.

Also, because the pattern file is separate from the source file, it is possible to generate machine code for a processor with a different instruction set from a source file with one instruction set, if you don't mind the effort of coding.

#### Usage

Use it like this: `python axx.py patternfile.axx [sample.s] [-o outfile.bin]`.

axx reads assembler pattern data from the first argument, and assembles the source file of the second argument based on the pattern data. If the second argument is omitted, the source is input from the standard input.

The result is output as text to the standard output, and if there is an argument specified with the `-o` option, a binary file is output to the current directory.

In axx, the assembly language source file or the line input from the standard input is named an assembly line.

#### Explanation of pattern data

The pattern data in the pattern file is arranged as follows:

```
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
:
:
```

Instruction cannot be omitted. Error_patterns can be omitted. Binary_list cannot be omitted.

Instruction, error_patterns, and binary_list should be separated by `::`.

for ex. (x86_64)

```
RET :: 0xc3
```

There are two types of pattern data:

```
(1) instruction :: binary_list
(2) instruction :: error_patterns :: binary_list
```

#### Comments

If you write `/*` in the pattern file, the part after `/*` on that line becomes a comment. Currently, you cannot close it with `*/`. Only the part after `/*` on that line is valid.

Assembly line comments are `;`.

#### Case Sensitivity, Variables

Uppercase letters in the pattern file instructions are treated as character constants. Lowercase letters are treated as one-character variables. The value of the factor, expression, or symbol at that position in the instruction is assigned to the variable from the assembly line, and referenced from error_patterns and binary_list.

Lowercase letters a through g represent expressions, h through n represent factors such as constants, and o through z represent symbols. All unassigned variables have a default value of 0.

Uppercase and lowercase letters are accepted by the assembly line as the same.

A special variable is '$$', which represents the current location counter.

#### Operator precedence

The operators and precedence are as follows, based on Python

```
(expression)     An expression enclosed in parentheses
#                An operator that returns the value of a symbol
-,~              Negative, bitwise NOT
@                A unary operator that returns the bit position from the right of the most significant bit of the following value
:=               Assignment operator
**               Exponentiation
*,//             Multiplication, integer division
+,-              Addition, subtraction
<<,>>            Left shift, right shift
&                Bitwise AND
|                Bitwise OR
^                Bitwise XOR
'                Sign extension
<=,<,>,>=,!=,==  Comparison operators
not(x)           Logical NOT
&&               Logical AND
||               Logical OR
```



There is an assignment operator `:=`. If you enter `d:=24`, 24 will be assigned to the variable d. The value of the assignment operator is the assigned value.

The prefix operator `#` takes the value of the following symbol.

The prefix operator `@` returns the number of bits in the value that follows. We call this the snake-shaped Marmatta operator.

The binary operator `'`, for example `a'24`, will sign extend (Sign EXtend) the 24th bit of a as the sign bit. We call this the SEX operator.

The binary operator `**` is exponentiation.

#### Escape character

The escape character `\` can be used in the instruction.

#### error_patterns

error_patterns uses variables and comparison operators to specify the conditions under which an error occurs.

Multiple error patterns can be specified, separated by ','. For example, as follows.

```
a>3;4,b>7;5
```
In this example, if a>3, error code 4 is returned, and if b>7, error code 5 is returned.

#### binary_list

binary_list specifies the code to be output, separated by ','. For example, if you specify 0x03,d, d will be output after 0x3.

Let's take 8048 as an example. If the pattern file contains

```
ADD A,Rn :: n>7;5 :: n|0x68
```

and you pass `add a,rn` to the assembly line, it will return error code 5 if n>7, and 0x69 will be generated with `add a,r1`.

If an element of binary_list is empty, it will be aligned. If you start with `,` or specify `0x12,,0x13`, the empty part will be padded to the exact address.

#### symbol

```
.setsym :: symbol :: n
```

Writing this defines symbol with the value n.

Symbols are letters, numbers, and strings of other symbols.

To define symbol2 with symbol1, write as follows.

```
.setsym ::symbol1 ::1
.setsym ::symbol2 ::#symbol1
```

Here is an example of a symbol definition for z80. If you write the following in a pattern file:

```
.setsym ::B ::0
.setsym ::C ::1
.setsym ::D ::2
.setsym ::E ::3
.setsym ::H ::4
.setsym ::L ::5
.setsym ::A ::7
.setsym ::BC ::0x00
.setsym ::DE ::0x10
.setsym ::HL ::0x20
.setsym ::SP ::0x30
```

The symbols B, C, D, E, H, L, A, BC, DE, HL, and SP will be defined as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0x00, 0x10, 0x20, and 0x30, respectively. Symbols are not case sensitive.

If there are multiple definitions of the same symbol in a pattern file, the new one will replace the old one. That is,

```
.setsym ::B::0
.setsym ::C::1
ADD A,s

.setsym ::NZ::0
.setsym ::Z::1
.setsym ::NC::2
.setsym ::C ::3
RET s
```
In this case, the C in ADD A,C is 1, and the C in RET C is 3.

ãƒ»Example of a symbol that contains a mixture of symbols, numbers, and letters

```
.setsym ::$s5:: 21
```

To clear all symbols, use `.clearsym`.

```
.clearsym
```

You can determine the character set to use for symbols from within the pattern file.

```
.symbolc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters in <characters>.

The default is letters + numbers + '_%$-~&|'.

#### Example of binary output

```
.setsym:: BC:: 0x00
.setsym:: DE:: 0x10
.setsym:: HL:: 0x20
LD s,d:: (s&0xf!=0)||(s>>4)>3;9 :: s|0x01,d&0xff,d>>8
```

Then, `ld bc,0x1234, ld de,0x1234, ld hl,0x1234` output `0x01,0x34,0x12, 0x11,0x34,0x12, 0x21,0x34,0x12`, respectively.

#### Pattern order

```
(1) LD A,(HL)
(2) LD A,d
```

Pattern files are evaluated from top to bottom, so the one placed first takes precedence. Special patterns are placed first, and general patterns are placed last.

#### Double brackets

Optional elements in the instruction can be enclosed in double brackets. This shows the `inc (ix)` instruction for z80.

```
INC (IX[[+d]]) :: 0xdd,0x34,d
```

In this case, the initial value of the lowercase variable is 0, so if `inc (ix+0x12)` is used and not omitted, `0xdd,0x34,0x12` is output, and if `inc (ix)` is omitted, `0xdd,0x34,0x00` is output.

#### label

Labels can be defined from the assembly line in the following way.

```
label1:
label2: .equ 0x10
label3: nop
```

A label is a string of letters, numbers, and symbols, starting with a non-numeric ``.`, alphabet, or symbol, and is two or more characters long.

To define a label with a label, do the following:

```
label4: .equ label1
```

You can determine the character set to be used in the label from within the pattern file.

```
.labelc::<characters>
```

You can specify characters other than numbers and uppercase and lowercase letters in <characters>.

The default is letters + numbers + underscore. Only `.` as the first character is allowed in the label.

#### ORG

ORG is set to

```
.org 0x800
```
from the assemble line.

#### alignment and padding

Setting

```
.padding 0x12
```

from the pattern file will set the padding bytecode to 0x12. The default is 0x00.

Setting

```
.align 16
```

from the assemble line will align to 16.

### Floating point, number notation

For example, suppose you have a processor that includes floating point operands, and `MOVF fa,3.14` loads 3.14 into the fa register, with the opcode being 01. In that case, the pattern data would be

```
MOVF FA,d ::0x01,d>>24,d>>16,d>>8,d
```

And if you pass `movf fa,0f3.14` to the assemble line, the binary output will be 0x01,0xc3,0xf5,0x48,0x40.

Prefix binary numbers with '0b'.

Prefix hexadecimal numbers with '0x'.

Prefix floating point float (32bit) with '0f'.

For floating-point doubles (float 64bit), prefix them with '0d'.

### Tests of some instructions on some processors

This is a test, so the binary is different from the actual code.

### Comments

-Sorry for original notation.

-Error checking is lax.

-I know it's a ridiculous request, but quantum computers and LISP machines are not supported.
The assembly language of quantum computers is called quantum assembly, and is not assembly language.
LISP machine programs are not assembly language.

-From homemade processors to supercomputers, please enjoy. Meow.

- Since it requires the installation of an emulator, it does not support run-time variable-length byte instructions.

- It is possible to assemble processors with less than 8 bits, such as bit slice processors, or processors whose machine language words are not in bytes, but the output must be processed slightly.

- The pattern data is written differently depending on the addressing mode.

- Please evaluate and extend and fix this.

- If the pattern file is made into a meta-language, it is easier to check for errors. It is highly readable. It does not depend on the order of evaluation. It is also easier to set the binary [Do not output] item.

- If there is label definition from the pattern data and assembly line, it may be possible to create a language.

## Future issues

- The order of evaluation of the pattern file is difficult, so we will do something about it.

- Make it possible for the linker to handle it.

- Do some more error checking.

- The escape character in the expression does not work, so I would like to solve it.

- Instructions with x86_64 prefixes must be split into two lines, so I would like to solve it. â†’This can be solved with a macro function.

- We would like to add a macro function.

- Support binary file formats. Depending on the binary file specifications, it can also support bit slices of less than 8 bits, and processors whose word lengths are not in bytes.

- There are not enough symbols, so we are considering using extended ASCII code.

## Request

Please let me know if you find any bugs. I'll do my best to fix them.
Please evaluate and extend and fix this.
